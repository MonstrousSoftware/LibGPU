## To Do list


- generate mipmaps in a compute shader
- generate IBL textures (env, irradiance, radians) from a single file

- support color per vertex as option in the standard shader
- sphere builder
- better support for texture coordinates in mesh builder

- use a shared mesh for gltf models instead of a mesh per primitive






## Bugs to fix
- post shader demo is broken
